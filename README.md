## My process

- This was the first part of a series where I build out designs I find and try to implement best practices. This is for practice purposes. At this point, I was preparing for my first frontend developer position and was watching a lot of React YouTubers such as Jack Herrington and Web Dev Junkie.

### Built with

- TailwindCSS
- React
- Redux
- React hook form

### What I learned

- **Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

- This project is a continuing playground for me to implement and refactor my code for best practices. The following are things I want to add in order to prepare myself as a fullstack web engineer. I will add more to it as I learn more about what I do not yet know.
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- SEO
- Build out backend with tRPC and/or React query
- Testing
- CI/CD eg. with GitHub actions
- AWS
- Next.js
- Prisma
- Dark mode
- Cross-browser compatibility
